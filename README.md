Mobile version is in the "m" folder. I have not included the script to switch from desktop to mobile automatically but I understand that there is a rather simple way to do it. The desktop version is so-so, the layout might be a bit messy and unclear at times. Mobile version, however is very clean and easy to navigate through the markup and style. That is because it took me some time to get the hang of different display layouts that the css provides. The index page has animations which I made as hover only as to not have a lot of distracting "jumpy" things on the page.
